# Big Beill's Greenhouse

_A showcase project demonstrating web-development, networking, and cybersecurity skills._

Big Beill's Greenhouse is a personalized project created by Mackenzie Neill, a graduate of Trent University's Computer Science program. This project serves as a platform to explore and refine skill's in web-development, networking, and cybersecurity. As an experimental project, it's a continuous work in progress and isn't being actively monitored for security vulnerabilities. Consequently, data protection is limited, and users should exercise caution when using the application.

## Setting Up the Project

<ol>
	<li>Open the <code>run_website.txt</code> file in the root directory.</li>
	<li>Set the URL to the path where you saved this project.</li>
	<li>Save the file with a <code>.bat</code> extension (or respective file type if you're not using windows).</li>
	<li>Inside the <code>client</code> folder, create a <code>.env</code> file and add:</li>
	<pre><code>
		VITE_SERVER_LOCATION=http://localhost:4000
	</code></pre>
	<li>Inside the `server` folder, create a `.env` file and add:</li>
	<pre><code>
		SESSION_SECRET=
		LOCAL_ENVIRONMENT=true
	</code></pre>
	<li>Fill in a value for `SESSION_SECRET` (choose a strong secret, use sha256 for best security).</li>
	<li>Run the `.bat` file (assuming your on windows), or run npm run dev at root.</li>
</ol>

### Setting up the databases

#### MongoDB database

<ol>
	<li>Create your own MongoDB cluster online.</li>
	<li>Update the connection string in `server/config/connectMongo.js`.</li>
	<li>Add the following line to the server’s `.env` file:</li>
	<pre><code>
	MONGO_DB_PASSWORD=
	</code></pre>
	<li>Fill in your MongoDB password.</li>
	<li>Go to `/canadian-nutrient-file/DB_Setup.md` for instructions and code.</li>
</ol>

#### PostgreSQL server

1. refer to [setup docs](canadian-nutrient-file/DB_Setup.md)
2. Set .env variables under `./server/.env`

```
# Assuming local development
POSTGRES_DB_HOST="localhost"
POSTGRES_DB_USER="myuser"
POSTGRES_DB_DATABASE="Canadian Nutrient File"
POSTGRES_DB_PASSWORD="<yourPasswordHere>"
POSTGRES_DB_PORT="5432"
```
